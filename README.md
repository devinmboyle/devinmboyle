## Hi, I'm Devin!

I'm a backend software engineer with 6+ years of experience across the telecom, LNG, healthcare, and payments industries.
I studied Computer Science at University of Alaska Anchorage, but have recently moved to Nevada.
I spend my personal time on creative writing that I occasionally [blog](https://welltree.blog/) and getting outdoors, but I'll be spending more time in the near future building out my GitHub while brushing up on some C# and JavaScript.
